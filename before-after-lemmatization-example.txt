i got married a few weeks ago and i really like this ring my fiancee and i scoured around different jewelry shops to look for our wedding bands i noticed that the mens bands made from alternative metals were very good in most shops and in the range of dollars that is already a huge difference from what you would pay for a white gold or platinum ring however most of these alternative metal bands displayed in the shops were size the standard display size and given that these rings could not be resized they told me i would have to wait or weeks to order them that is how i started to check out rings online all i really wanted was a clean beveled cobalt ring this ring by cavalier looks just as good as those i have seen in the shops the price is unbelievable i prefer cobalt over tungsten because it has a brighter look that almost resembles white gold this ring has a very nice texture and i kind of play with it often just as gollum played with the ring i also quite like the fact that the only word in the inside of the ring is cobalt and none of those fancy phrases such as brute etc or a huge brand name that you will find in other rings please keep up the good work cavalier jewelers
